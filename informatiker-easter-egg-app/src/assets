The `/src/assets` directory is intended to hold media files such as images or animations. Since you haven't specified any particular assets to include, I will create a placeholder file structure for potential assets related to the TCP 3-Way Handshake animation and the logbook. 

Here are the contents for the `/src/assets` directory:

/src/assets
- tcp_handshake_animation.gif
- logbook_animation.gif

These files are placeholders and should be replaced with actual media files as needed for your project.
